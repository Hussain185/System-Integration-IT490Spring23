# CompileCart
This git repo contains our main SaaS called CompileCart. 
**CompileCart** is a website thatâ€™s main feature is to enable registered users to search for recipes using the **Edaman API**. 
Users would be able to filter their search based on dropdown menus titled **dietLabel, cuisineType, mealType**
> (Ex. Search: Cake, dietLabel: Low-Fat, cuisineType: American, mealType: Teatime)

Once the user clicks Enter, the page will display the top result of their search providing: 
the **image** of the recipe, the **title** of the recipe, the **url** to the source of the recipe, and the amount of **calories** the recipe has. 
This feature is planned to be finished before the final deadline.

Another feature that our service has is the ability to create a **Food Blog Post** and have it displayed in the Home Page. 
We are also planning to implement a **Dietary Calculator** on one of the web pages before we submit the final draft.

CompileCart is supposed to also extract the ingredients needed from the recipe, and compile a shopping list for the user. 
However, at the moment, this functionality has not been implemented. 
This also applies to the Weekly Meal Planner, which will enable users to schedule a time to prepare the meals.
